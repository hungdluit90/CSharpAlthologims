You are given a special set of pure numbers.
A pure number has the following properties:
1. It comprises only 4 and 5.
2. It is a palindrome number.
3. The number of digits in a pure number is even.
For example, 4444,5445,44 are the pure numbers while 12,444,4545 are not. You have to generate a list of
pure numbers in an ascending order. So, purenumber[1] < purenumber[2].
The ô€ƒ’rst few elements in the list are as follows: 44,55,4444,....
You will be given an integer and you have to ô€ƒ’nd pure number from the generated list.
